== multiex ==
Multiex module created for reduce size overhead by a lot of small utilities written in golang.
If compile every utility independent - each will have 4-6MB overhead by golang runtime and same libraries: fmt, http, etc

Multiex module allow compile many utilities in one binary executable file with once runtime and libraries overhead.
One of purpose is max simple adaptation current utilities and modules.


=== Usage ===

Usage of module very simple:
# Create a global project, which include all small modules for compile in a binary
# Register every utility in multiex from source code. It can be do from one main function or every small module can register own commands
independent from own init function.
# Compile
# Create symlinks by command <your-binary> --multiex-command=multiex install
